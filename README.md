# CMPE283 : Virtualization 
# Assignment 3:Instrumentation Via Hypercall(Continued..)
- Your assignment is to modify the CPUID emulation code in KVM to report back additional information when special CPUID leaf nodes are requested.
  - For CPUID leaf node %eax=0x4FFFFFFE:
   - Return the number of exits for the exit number provided (on input) in %ecx
   - This value should be returned in %eax.
  - For CPUID leaf node %eax=0x4FFFFFFF:
    - Return the time spent processing the exit number provided (on input) in %ecx
    - Return the high 32 bits of the total time spent for that exit in %ebx
    - Return the low 32 bits of the total time spent for that exit in %ecx

#### 2. Describe in detail the steps you used to complete the assignment. Consider your reader to be someone  skilled in software development but otherwise unfamiliar with the assignment. Good answers to this  question will be recipes that someone can follow to reproduce your development steps. Note: I may decide to follow these instructions for random assignments, so you should make sure  they are accurate.

### Step 1 
- Created a VM on gcloud using the insturctions that are required for creating a virtualization machine with virtualization capabilities enabled.
- use cloud shell commmand to get the details about the account from google compute engine
- add additional details to the cloud shell command to launch instance using instructions provided.
- generate ssh key on your local machine if it not exits `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`
- Final cloud shell command with all the vm capabilitis with your ssh keys in metadata.
```

```
![](screenshots/instance_launched.png)
- Launched Instance with the SSH Keys Metadata added.

![](screenshots/ssh_keys.png)

- We can Login to the launched instance using two methods
    - ssh connect from the google compute engine [instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances) page. Connected instance through SSH, launched on a web browser.
    ![](screenshots/3.connected_instance.png)
    - ssh connect to the instance where the private key exist for the public key that has been added for your users.
    ![](screenshots/ssh_login_siri.png)
    ![](screenshots/ssh_login_jayanth.png)

### Step 2 
- Installed required dependencies to perform the assignment that can help to build kernel from source code with changes for our assignment and Launch a New VM on Kernel we are building with changes for a hyper call.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install vim gcc make linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt-get install git fakeroot build-essential ncurses-dev xz-utils libssl-dev bc flex libelf-dev bison
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-kvm -y
sudo apt-get install cloud-image-utils
```
![](screenshots/install_dependencies.png)

### Step 3
- Download and Build `linux-6.0.7` source code  
```
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.0.7.tar.xz
tar xvf linux-6.0.7.tar.xz
cd linux-6.0.7
cp -v /boot/config-$(uname -r) .config
```
- Note : Fix `No rule to make target 'debian/canonical-certs.pem'` by the following commands
  - `scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS`
  - `scripts/config --disable SYSTEM_REVOCATION_KEYS`
- Build the kernel source code using the following commands.     
```
sudo make -j <number_of_cpu_cores> modules
sudo make -j <number_of_cpu_cores>
sudo make -j <number_of_cpu_cores> modules_install
sudo make -j <number_of_cpu_cores>install
```
![](screenshots/make_modules_install.png) 
- After `make -j <number_of_cores> install` the bootloader is automatically updated.
![](screenshots/make_install.png)

- We can ensure that the kernel has been updated by the `sudo reboot` and `uname -mrs`.
  - Output should be `Linux 6.0.7 x86_64`
![](screenshots/reboot.png)
![](screenshots/uname_reboot.png)

### Step 4
- Make Code Changes to Implement Functionality for leaf nodes 0x4FFFFFFC and 0x4FFFFFFD and rebuild kernel
- vmx.c: [`linux-6.0.7/arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c`](arch/x86/kvm/vmx/vmx.c)
- cpuid.c: [`linux-6.0.7/arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c`](arch/x86/kvm/cpuid.c)
- Rebuild change modules using `make -j <number_of_cores> modules` 
- Install New Modules in to kernel using `make -j <number_of_cores> INSTALL_MOD_STRIP=1 modules_install`
- Reload kvm and kvm_intel modules
  - `sudo rmmod kvm_intel`
  - `sudo rmmod kvm`
  - `sudo modprobe kvm_intel`
  - `sudo modprobe kvm`

### Step 5
- Launch an instance on host kernel using the following commands and setup
- Get Image for launching VM using `wget https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/bionic/current/bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img` 
- Create `user-data` file with following contents.
```
#cloud-config
password: newpass #new password here
chpasswd: { expire: False }
ssh_pwauth: True
``` 
- Run `cloud-localds user-data.img user-data`
- Launch an VM using `sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -hda bionic-server-cloudimg-amd64.img -drive "file=user-data.img,format=raw" -m 512 -curses -nographic --accel`
- Login to VM using username `ubuntu` and password `newpass`
![](screenshots/vm_launched.png)
### Step 6 
- Testing CPUID on the VM and Observing Behavior on the Host Modified Kernel for Hypercall
- Install required items on host vm for observing behavior of cpuid hypercall `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install cpuid`
- Tested cpuid `0x4FFFFFFE` and `0x4FFFFFFE` using the following script.
```
#!/bin/bash

for i in {0..76}
do
    echo "EXIT $i"
    cpuid -l $1 -s $i
done
```
- run `bash test_cpuid.sh 0x4ffffffe`
![](screenshots/cpuid_ffe.png)
- dmesg output for `cpuid -l 0x4FFFFFFE`
![](screenshots/dmesg_ffe.png) 
- run `bash test_cpuid.sh 0x4fffffff`
![](screenshots/cpuid_fff.png)
- dmesg output for `cpuid -l 0x4FFFFFFF`
![](screenshots/dmesg_fff.png) 
- Full [DMESG log](screenshots/dmesg.out) and Test CPUID Logs for [0x4FFFFFFE](screenshots/test_output_ffe.log) and [0x4FFFFFFF](screenshots/test_output_fff.log)

#### Assignment 3 Question Observation.  

- Comment on the frequency of exits â€“ does the number of exits increase at a stable rate? Or are there more exits performed during certain VM operations? Approximately how many exits does a full VM boot entail?
  - We have Observered Exit(10) and Exit(12) Increase at a stable Rate. During our observation as they are frequently called for every execution.
```
[  455.315082] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(10) is called 242471 times.
[  458.987147] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(10) is called 242480 times.
[  468.354860] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(10) is called 242489 times.
[  499.694458] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(12) is called 6099 times.
[  502.096696] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(12) is called 6116 times.
[  504.311474] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFE) EXIT(12) is called 6135 times.
```
  - A Reboot also generated 1879264 exits.
```
[ 1165.829292] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFC), Total Exits = 1804702
[ 1168.363287] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFC), Total Exits = 1805330
[ 1170.645720] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFC), Total Exits = 1810762
[ 1358.589315] CPUID(0x4FFFFFFC), Total Exits = 3690026
```
- Of the exit types defined in the SDM, which are the most frequent? Least?
  - The Following is the frequency we have obbserved during our assignment 2 & 3.
  - Most Frequent are EXIT(30), EXIT(49) & EXIT(28)
  - Least Frequent are EXIT(0), EXIT(54) & EXIT(29)
```
